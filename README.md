# Magpie theme for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) game library manager
Heavily influenced by the the [Metro for Steam Skin](https://www.metroforsteam.com/) and Epic Launcher's clean design, with a focus on flexibility, customizability and the occasional addition of functions that I desire for personal use.
### Outstanding features:
 * __[ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin) by Lacro59 support.__ If you don't like my color scheme or want more or less transparency, you can do it yourself.
 * __Logo & Header Support__ Without compromising existing metadata like icons. Thanks to a hack learned from joyrider3774, logos may optionally be added to your games.
 * __Rounded cover corners!__ I think they look nice.
 
### Supporting or Compatible Extensions for Playnite:
 * __[Extra Metadata Tools](https://playnite.link/forum/thread-575.html) by DarkLinkPower__ - Implementing flexible support for additional metadata media was a shared goal and this extension will facilitate acquiring or adapting logos and other custom media for use in this and other themes.
 * __[ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin)__ - As mentioned above, many aspects of the theme have ben made available to be adjusted with this extension from the settings menu. Those who prefer can do the same by manually editing the contained Constants.xaml file, however.
  * __[HowLongToBeat Plugin](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-howlongtobeat-plugin) by Lacro59__ - Useful and if custom theme integration is enabled, the button is appropriately themed and located with the edit button.
  * __[SuccessStory Plugin](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-successstory-plugin) by Lacro59__ - Another excellent plugin. Integration with Magpie is limited but coherent like with HowLongToBeat. I don't care too much for achievements but it's good to have unified access to them.
