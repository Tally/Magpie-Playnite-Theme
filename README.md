# Magpie theme for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) game library manager
Heavily influenced by the the [Metro for Steam Skin](https://www.metroforsteam.com/) and Epic Launcher's clean design, with a focus on flexibility, customizability and the occasional addition of functions that I desire for personal use.
#### Outstanding features:
 * __[ThemeModifier](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-thememodifier-plugin) by Lacro59 support.__ If you don't like my color scheme or want more or less transparency, you can do it yourself.
 * __Logo support.__ Thanks to a hack learned from joyrider3774, logos may optionally be added to your games by simply placing a logo.png file in the relevant metadata folder.
 * __Rounded cover corners!__ I think they look nice.
